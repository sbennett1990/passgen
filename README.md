# passgen

Simple, command line password generator utility. Can generate random passowrds up to
50 characters long (although, that limit is arbitrary and easily changed).

The cloud is scary. Why on earth would you use a webpage to generate random passwords?
It's best to use a native utility that does not talk to the internet.

Currently only builds on OpenBSD, because what other platform would you trust to
generate good random numbers?
